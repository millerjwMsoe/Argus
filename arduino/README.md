# Arduino Code

This contains all code that runs on the Arduinos.

* ArduinoMegaFinal: Reads hall effect sensors for RPM, communicates via Bluetooth w/ weight Arduino, communicates via serial w/ Pi.

* ArduinoUnoExcavation: Reads the load cell and photoresistors for weight data, communicates via Bluetooth to main Arduino.
